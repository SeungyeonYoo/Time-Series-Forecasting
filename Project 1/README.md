# Forecasting with a Seasonal-Trend Model



## Overview
This project attempts to model the monthly retail trades in the United States, spanning from 1992 to 2023. The primary focus of the project is on capturing the trend and seasonal components of the time series data and using this model for forecasting the retail trades for the next 12 months.

## Data
The dataset used for this project is downloaded from the FRED Economic data website (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RSXFSN). The observation frequency of the data is monthly and was preprocessed for analysis.

## Methods
The modeling approach adopted in this project is centered around a Trend-Seasonal model. This involves decomposing the time series into its trend and seasonal components, allowing for a more detailed understanding of the underlying patterns.
